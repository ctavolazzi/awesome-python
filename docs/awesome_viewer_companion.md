## MVP Overview

### Audience
- Maintainers of the Awesome Python catalog who want a quick way to review curated entries.
- Curious developers exploring Python libraries, frameworks, and learning resources.
- Contributors validating that their submissions render correctly and include the expected metadata.

### Objectives
1. **Surface the catalog quickly** so visitors can discover categories and entries without reading raw Markdown.
2. **Support lightweight exploration** with search, filtering, and detail previews that work on desktop and mobile devices.
3. **Remain simple to host** by producing static assets that can be uploaded to any static hosting provider or served locally.

### Feature Scope
- Generate a static site from the catalog data via `python examples/awesome_viewer/generate_site.py build` (also available through the module entry point).
- Provide category navigation and live search with minimal client-side JavaScript.
- Display entry metadata (name, description, GitHub stats when available) in a concise, keyboard-friendly card layout.
- Offer preview modes that list or step through parsed categories, automatically falling back to non-blocking output in CI.
- Include responsive styling that keeps the layout readable on common viewport sizes.

### Success Criteria & Non-Goals
- **Success Criteria**: A reproducible CLI workflow that emits HTML, CSS, JS, and machine-readable JSON (`catalog.json`, `manifest.json`); comprehensive documentation so new contributors can get started in minutes; automated tests that lock down parsing, build outputs, and preview behaviour; an interface with search, category navigation, and a preview panel that can be browsed without touching the Markdown source.
- **Explicit Non-Goals**: Server-side APIs, authentication, personalization, advanced analytics, automated screenshot capture, or heavy frontend frameworks. These can be revisited after validating the MVP.

### Technical Requirements
- **Build Pipeline**: Python 3.9+ script that parses the repository `README.md`, extracts categories and entries, and writes pre-rendered HTML alongside CSS/JS bundles and JSON payloads to a `build/` directory.
- **Templates**: Jinja2-based rendering with reusable sections for hero metrics, sidebar navigation, and entry cards.
- **Client Logic**: Lightweight JavaScript (no framework) that powers search indexing, keyboard-aware navigation, and focus synchronisation while keeping the uncompressed bundle under ~100 KB.
- **Styling**: A single CSS asset emphasizing accessibility (WCAG AA contrast, visible focus states) and responsive breakpoints for desktop/tablet/mobile.
- **Testing**: Unit tests covering data parsing, site building, CLI defaults, preview flows, and module entry equivalence, plus smoke tests that assert key sections of the output.
- **Documentation**: README guidance covering build, preview, serve, and deploy workflows, supported by this comprehensive guide.

### MVP Risks & Mitigations
- **Parsing drift**: Catalog format changes could break extraction. Mitigate with regression tests that assert expected category counts and manifest metadata.
- **Bundle bloat**: Extra libraries could inflate load times. Track bundle size during build and enforce a budget through CI checks.
- **Accessibility regressions**: Rapid UI iteration may degrade a11y. Run automated audits (axe, Lighthouse) and document manual testing steps.

### Expert Recommendations
- Keep parsing, template rendering, and asset management in dedicated modules to simplify maintenance.
- Invest in tests early to catch regressions as the catalog evolves.
- Maintain a lean tooling stack; favour progressive enhancement over heavy frameworks until requirements demand more.
- Document CLI options, preview behaviour, and contribution guidelines to streamline future enhancements.
- Collect feedback from catalog maintainers and users after shipping the MVP to prioritise upgrades (advanced filtering, offline support, packaging).

## Local Testing Workflow

Follow these steps to exercise the Awesome Viewer MVP on your machine before shipping changes:

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r examples/awesome_viewer/requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the automated tests**
   ```bash
   pytest examples/awesome_viewer/tests
   ```
3. **Build the static site**
   ```bash
   python examples/awesome_viewer/generate_site.py build
   ```
   Review the printed preview and confirm that `index.html`, `catalog.json`, and `manifest.json` exist in the chosen output directory.
4. **Serve the site locally**
   ```bash
   python examples/awesome_viewer/generate_site.py serve --port 8765 --no-build
   ```
   Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8765` to browse the refreshed interface. Use the search box, category chips, and step-through preview panel to verify the interactive behaviour.
5. **Optional Makefile shortcuts**
   ```bash
   make viewer_install
   make viewer_build
   make viewer_serve
   ```
   These commands wrap the same workflow and are helpful for repeat runs in CI or documentation.

## Development Dossier

### Date
- 2025-10-17 UTC

### Objective
- Deliver a production-ready Awesome Viewer MVP that enables local exploration of the Awesome Python catalog through an interactive, keyboard-friendly web interface and a flexible CLI workflow.

### Summary Highlights
- Completed an end-to-end viewer stack: Markdown ingestion, deterministic parsing, metadata-rich build artifacts, and an ergonomic CLI with preview modes and serve support.
- Crafted a responsive HTML/CSS/JS experience with hero statistics, category navigation, search-driven filtering, and a focus pane optimised for keyboard navigation.
- Established a supporting documentation suite (this guide plus README updates) to accelerate onboarding and downstream collaboration.
- Locked in regression coverage for parser edge cases, build outputs, preview fallbacks, and invocation pathways (script, module, default command) to protect the MVP surface.

### Detailed Timeline
| Phase | Activities | Key Artifacts / Commands | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ideation & Scope | Captured MVP audience, goals, feature set, non-goals, and risks. | See [MVP Overview](#mvp-overview) | Aligns stakeholders on "done" criteria and guardrails. |
| Tooling Setup | Added Makefile shortcuts, requirements, and package init modules. | `Makefile`, `examples/__init__.py`, `examples/awesome_viewer/requirements.txt` | Simplifies installs and Python module execution. |
| Backend Implementation | Built parser, builder, and CLI orchestration (defaulting to build). | `examples/awesome_viewer/viewer/{data,builder}.py`, `examples/awesome_viewer/generate_site.py` | Emits HTML plus `catalog.json`/`manifest.json`; handles preview fallback logic. |
| Front-end Implementation | Authored template, CSS, and JS assets for the viewer UI. | `examples/awesome_viewer/templates/index.html.j2`, `examples/awesome_viewer/assets/{style.css,app.js}` | Introduces hero stats, sidebar chips, entry cards, keyboard shortcuts. |
| Quality & Testing | Added pytest suites for data parsing, builder outputs, CLI behaviour, preview modes, and CLI entry points. | `examples/awesome_viewer/tests/*.py`, `pytest examples/awesome_viewer/tests` | Ensures stability across interactive/non-interactive environments. |
| Documentation & Ops | Produced README updates, local testing guidance, and this comprehensive dossier. | `README.md`, `examples/awesome_viewer/README.md`, `docs/awesome_viewer_companion.md` | Supports contributors validating builds and capturing evidence. |

### Technical Deliverables

#### Backend & CLI
- CLI entry points: `examples/awesome_viewer/generate_site.py` and `python -m examples.awesome_viewer` share the same argument parser with default build behaviour.
- `BuildResult` dataclass exposes paths to emitted `index.html`, `catalog.json`, and `manifest.json`, enabling downstream tooling to reuse catalog metadata without reparsing Markdown.
- Preview subsystem provides `list` and `step` modes with detection for non-interactive sessions, EOF safety, and automatic fallback to avoid CI hangs.
- Serve command wraps the build process (unless `--no-build`) and starts a simple HTTP server for live previewing the generated site.

#### Data & Metadata Layer
- `examples/awesome_viewer/viewer/data.py` parses the primary `README.md`, normalises categories, captures entry metadata (name, description, URL, GitHub stats when available), and surfaces aggregate counts.
- `catalog.json` serialises the normalised data for API-like reuse; `manifest.json` stores build metadata (timestamps, source hash, totals) for reproducibility.

#### Front-End Experience
- Jinja2 template (`examples/awesome_viewer/templates/index.html.j2`) renders hero metrics, category sidebar, search input, responsive card grid, and a focus preview panel.
- `examples/awesome_viewer/assets/style.css` defines layout, typography, light/dark theme friendliness, and adaptive breakpoints for desktop and mobile widths.
- `examples/awesome_viewer/assets/app.js` powers keyboard navigation, focus synchronisation between sidebar chips and entry cards, live filtering, and stat refresh without page reloads.

#### Documentation & Enablement
- README updates outline quick-start commands (`python -m examples.awesome_viewer`, `make viewer_build`, `make viewer_serve`) and highlight preview behaviour.
- This guide consolidates the MVP vision, testing workflow, and detailed progress dossier for future contributors.

#### Quality Assurance
- Pytest modules verify parser normalisation, builder artifact integrity (HTML + JSON), CLI option defaults, module entry point parity, and preview resilience.
- Makefile targets (`viewer_install`, `viewer_build`, `viewer_serve`, `viewer_test`) standardise local workflows and lower the barrier to entry for contributors.

### Usage Snapshot (Latest Run)
- `python examples/awesome_viewer/generate_site.py build` → Generated the `build/` directory with HTML/JSON artifacts and emitted preview summaries (91 categories / 673 entries).
- `python examples/awesome_viewer/generate_site.py serve --port 8765 --no-build` → Served the prebuilt site for manual verification without rebuilding.
- `python examples/awesome_viewer/generate_site.py --preview-limit 1` → Confirmed default build execution when no subcommand is provided and preview limiting functions correctly.
- `pytest examples/awesome_viewer/tests` → Passed all parser, builder, CLI, and preview tests.
- `make viewer_build` → Demonstrated the Makefile shortcut for invoking the build with environment sanity checks.

### Testing History
| Command | Purpose | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pip install -r examples/awesome_viewer/requirements.txt` | Install runtime dependencies (Jinja2, Markdown parsing). | Success |
| `pytest examples/awesome_viewer/tests` | Validate parser, builder, CLI, preview behaviour. | Success |
| `python examples/awesome_viewer/generate_site.py build --preview-limit 2 --preview-mode list` | Smoke-test build with constrained preview output. | Success |
| `python examples/awesome_viewer/generate_site.py build --preview-limit 1 --preview-mode step` | Exercise interactive step preview logic. | Success |
| `python examples/awesome_viewer/generate_site.py serve --port 8765 --no-build` | Verify dev server without rebuilding assets. | Success |
| `make viewer_build` | Run standardised build via Makefile. | Success |

### Metrics & Telemetry
- Categories parsed: **91**
- Entries parsed: **673**
- Build duration (local average): ~4 seconds on container baseline.
- Emitted artifacts: `build/index.html`, `build/catalog.json`, `build/manifest.json`, static assets in `build/assets/`.
- Preview output confirms category sequencing and sample entries for rapid visual verification in terminals.

### Operational Risks & Mitigations
- **Catalog drift**: README updates may break parser assumptions → Maintain parser tests and consider checksum-based alerts via `manifest.json`.
- **Accessibility refinements**: Current UI offers keyboard support but requires a dedicated a11y audit (ARIA roles, contrast checks) → Schedule accessibility review and automated tooling pass.
- **Packaging for distribution**: Local scripts rely on repo checkout → Plan packaging tasks to publish to PyPI or provide a standalone bundle.
- **Automation gaps**: Screenshot capture and deployment still manual → Integrate headless browser snapshot workflow and static hosting pipeline.

### Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. Automate CI pipeline to run tests, build artifacts, and upload screenshots for every change.
2. Package the viewer as an installable Python distribution (with entry points) to simplify adoption outside the repository.
3. Introduce incremental build support to detect catalog deltas and reduce rebuild time for large updates.
4. Conduct accessibility and responsive audits, addressing any contrast or focus issues surfaced.
5. Explore hosting options (GitHub Pages, Netlify) leveraging the generated `build/` directory for public sharing.

### Additional Notes
- Non-interactive environments automatically fall back to list previews, ensuring CI safety without special flags.
- Screenshot capture guidance lives in `examples/awesome_viewer/README.md`, including suggestions for top-of-page captures to avoid overly long images.
- All documentation assumes Python 3.11+, aligning with the repository's tooling baseline.
